# Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

This Python code defines a function, `get_min_max(ints)`, that takes a list of integers and returns the minimum and maximum values in the list. It uses an iterative approach to find these values.

## Reasoning Behind Code Decisions

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input list, `ints`, is empty. If the list is empty, the function returns `(None, None)` to indicate that there are no minimum and maximum values.

2. **Initialization**: The minimum and maximum values are initialized to the first element in the list, `ints[0]`.

3. **Iterative Search**: The code iterates through the list and updates the minimum and maximum values as it encounters smaller or larger numbers.

4. **Efficiency**: This code efficiently finds the minimum and maximum values with a single pass through the list. It compares each element to the current minimum and maximum values, reducing the time complexity to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
